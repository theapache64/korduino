> An attempt to write programs for Arduino in Kotlin

Korduino is a Kotlin compiler plugin that'll convert Kotlin code to Arduino C++ code or plain C++ code, compile the C++
code, upload it to the microcontroller and start a serial monitor to observe the output 🙌🏼

### ✨ Demo

POC Demo: https://x.com/theapache64/status/1961612291243458703

## 🦿 Prerequisites

- PlatformIO (for compiling C++, uploading, and serial monitor)

## ⌨️ Usage

## 🛣️ Roadmap

> Primary Goal: Arduino Support; Secondary Goal: Standard C++ Support

- [x] [POC](https://x.com/theapache64/status/1961612291243458703) showing end-to-end flow
- [x] Setup testing framework
- [x] Basic : println + delay support
- [x] Add mode support (C++/Arduino) (arch)
- [x] Add `pinMode` support
- [x] Setup PlatformIO installation (building, uploading, and serial monitor)
- [x] Add `function` support (with and without `return`)
- [x] Add `cpp` and `cppWithImport` to add raw CPP code without compile time check (more like asDynamic in KotlinJS)
- [x] Add `int/String/Long/Double/Float/Boolean/return` support
- [x] Mathematical Operators (`+-*/%`)
- [x] Missing setup()/loop() function handling
- [x] Increment/decrement operators (`++`, `--`)
- [x] Clean up and arch lookback
- [x] Augmented assignment operators `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`)
- [ ] 🚧 Comparison operators (`>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=, ===, !==`)
- [ ] Logical operators
- [ ] Indexed access operator (`[, ]`)
- [ ] Null safety operator (`.?`)
- [ ] Ranges
- [ ] Add `const` support
- [ ] Add `if-else` support
- [ ] Add `for` loop support
- [ ] Add `while` loop support
- [ ] Add `Array` support
- [ ] Add `List` support
- [ ] Add `Map` support
- [ ] Add nested structure support (nested-ifs, nested-loops etc)
- [ ] Add `Class/Object/init block/ constructor (both primary and secondary)` support
- [ ] Support all PIO boards via gradle plugin enum
- [ ] Add `extension function` support (with and without `return`)
- [ ] Add multi-file support
- [ ] Add networking support (For Arduino, via: `ESP8266HTTPClient.h` and `WiFiClientSecureBearSSL.h` )
- [ ] Add compiler flags for: setting mode (either Arduino/StandardC++), target platform (eg: `espressif8266` via an
  enum), board, framework, monitor_speed, upload speed (platform/IO).
  See [this](https://github.com/theapache64/green/blob/master/platformio.ini) for reference
- [ ] Add/verify testing support
- [ ] Release 0.0.1
- [ ] [Hard keyword](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/keyword-reference.html#hard-keywords) support
- [ ] [Soft keyword](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/keyword-reference.html#soft-keywords) support
- [ ] [Modifier keyword](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/keyword-reference.html#modifier-keywords) support
